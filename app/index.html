            <p>
              We want to create a world where anyone can build something
              meaningful with technology, and everyone has the learning tools,
              resources, and opportunities to do so. Code contains a world of
              possibilities — all that’s required is the curiosity and drive to
              learn. At <b>WestCoast Education</b>, we are committed to empowering all people,
              regardless of where they are in their coding journeys, to continue
              to learn, grow, and make an impact on the world around them.

            <h2>Why choose WestCoast Education?</h2>
            <h3>One-to-one instruction</h3>
            <p>
              All programs are specifically tailored to individual learning
              styles. We work with students of all ages and in most
              subject areas.
            </p>

            <h3>Experienced, certified teachers, most with advanced degrees</h3>
            <p>
              Our teachers use well-researched multisensory methodologies, which
              better equip them to offer the support their students need.
            </p>

            <h3>Complimentary initial consultation</h3>
            <p>
              This consultation includes an assessment of any existing testing
              reports to provide an appropriate, informed diagnosis of any
              learning difficulty with an accurate prescription designed to
              address the learner’s needs.
            </p>

            <h3>Comprehensive educational evaluations</h3>
            <p>
              Based on these evaluations, we prepare a thorough, prescriptive
              testing report that identifies the root of the specific learning
              difficulty and the programs that are appropriate for remediation.
              This allows us to address your child’s learning issues directly,
              correctly, and efficiently, minimizing the risk of wasted time and
              effort.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Test preparation programs provided in a one-to-one teaching format
            </h3>
            <p>
              In this way, we are able to take into account each individual’s
              academic skill level and learning style. The programs teach
              content and test taking strategies by focusing on the student’s
              weak areas.
